\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The following technical documentation will give further information for the implementation of the \textit{Internet Praktikum} from the group \texttt{HOTEL-Square}. The \textit{Internet Praktikum} aims at getting in touch with current web technologies, which "are becoming the basic building blocks of the next generation of Internet services"\footnote{\url{https://www.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/teaching/sommersemester-2017/internet-praktikum-tk-p4/}, 03.07.2017}. Therefore, state-of-the-art protocols and technologies are used to implement a specific task in a web based context.

\subsection{Task}
\label{subsec:task}
The task of the \textit{Internet Praktikum} in summer term 2017 is to reimplement a clone of the \textit{Foursquare Android} app. The task includes a well defined extend of compulsory features, which the app should support. There is the possibility of extending this compulsory feature list by some bonus features. 

In general, the task of the project includes the implementation of a well defined architecture, which comprises a development task for an \textit{Android} app (frontend) and a development task including a server in \textit{NodeJS} (backend). The backend should include a \textit{NoSQL} database and is allowed to query some third-party API-services. In opposite, the frontend is limited to communicate with the \textit{NodeJS}-server via some well-defined API.
